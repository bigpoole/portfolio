The idea is that companies will be able to build and onboard an apprenticeship team in days and it  will allow them pay-as-you-go flexibility. In order to do this,  companies need to create an apprenticeship on the RadicalX platform. This web app was designed to allow companies create apprenticeships on the platform.",
